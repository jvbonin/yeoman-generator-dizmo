# generator-dizmo [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Dizmo generator

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and *generator-dizmo* using [npm] (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-dizmo
```

On most operating systems the `-g` option (shortcut for `--global`) requires super user (administrator) rights: Therefore, on Unix like systems you might be required to run the above commands using either `sudo` (i.e. `sudo npm install -g yo` and `sudo npm install -g generator-dizmo`), or run them directly from your super user account of your operating system.

## Quick start

Invoke the dizmo generator with a name of your choice, for example `my-dizmo` and answer a few questions:

    yo dizmo my-dizmo

After a successful build, drag and drop the `./build/MyDizmo-0.0.0.dzm` file onto dizmoViewer: You should see the front side of the dizmo with `Hello World!` written on it.

The name parameter is optional and can be changed at the prompt. Further, calling `yo dizmo` is equivalent to invoking the default generator with `yo dizmo:app`.

To list all possible arguments and options of the generator, enter:

     yo dizmo --help

## Caching

[Npm] uses a built in [cache](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#cache) mechanism to accelerate package installation. There are various configuration options to control the behaviour of the cache. Here, we are interested in [cache-min](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#cache-min):

> The minimum time (in seconds) to keep items in the registry cache before re-checking against the registry. [default: 10]

The provided default of `10` seconds is too short, to efficiently make use of caching. Therefore, we recommend setting it to for example a week by running the configuration command:

    npm config set cache-min 604800

By setting `chache-min` to `604800`, you ensure that no package with a timestamp younger than a week is checked against the central registry for a possible update. This significantly improves your [npm] experience.

Further, we suggest to clear the cache initially by running `npm cache clean`, but this is not necessarily required: It will simply wipe out your cached packages, and ensure that no corrupted cache exists.

However, this also means that your very first dizmo skeleton generation (and corresponding installation of [npm] packages) will take longer than later invocations. By running `npm cache ls` you can determine, which [npm] packages have already been cached.

*Note:* It's recommended to clean the cache also before an update of the `generator-dizmo` generator itself, by running `npm cache clean`.

### Questions

At the start, you will be asked a few questions, after which the terminal should look similar to:

    ~/my-dizmos $ yo dizmo

         _-----_
        |       |    .--------------------------.
        |--(o)--|    |  Welcome to the awesome  |
       `---------´   |     dizmo generator!     |
        ( _´U`_ )    '--------------------------'
        /___A___\
         |  ~  |
       __'.___.'__
     ´   `  |° ´ Y `

    ? Name your dizmo: MyDizmo
    ? Describe it: My Dizmo
    ? And its bundle ID? com.example.my_dizmo
    ? What's your name? Name Surname
    ? And your email? name.surname@mail.net

The `dizmo` generator asks you some questions; let's have a look at them:

    ? Name your dizmo: MyDizmo

If no `dizmoName` argument is provided then by default `MyDizmo` will be suggested; accept, or change as desired. This name will be used to create a project folder in the current director: For example, for the `MyDizmo` name the folder would be `my-dizmo/`.

    ? Describe it: My Dizmo

You should provide a short succinct description of your project. By default the name of the current directory will be taken as a base for a suggestion.

    ? And its bundle ID? com.example.my_dizmo

Each dizmo is required to have a unique `bundle ID`, which is a name of the bundle each dizmo instance will belong to: For example, each sticky note dizmo would have the *same* `com.dizmo.stickynote` bundle ID (but with *different* dizmo IDs). Choose as a prefix the domain of your company (in reverse notation with the `com`, `org` etc. preceding the rest), and then append a name related to the dizmo.

    ? What's your name? Full Name

Provide your full name, to designate yourself as the author of the project. By default, the current GIT user name &ndash; if available &ndash; or OS login will be suggested. Anything you enter here will be remembered and automatically suggested as the default at your next invocation of `yo dizmo`.

The entry will be stored once the project skeleton is setup in `package.json` under `person.name`. For multiple contributors, see the [npm:package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) documentation, section [people-fields-author-contributors](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).

    ? And your email? my@email.net

Provide your email, so people can reach you for feedback, bug reports etc. By default the generator suggests the GIT user email &ndash; if available &ndash; or the `MAIL` environment variable (which you may want to correct with your proper email). Again, the next time you invoke `yo dizmo`, your most recent entry will be the new default suggestion.

The entry will be stored in `package.json` under `person.email`.
For multiple contributors, see again [people-fields-author-contributors](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#people-fields-author-contributors).

## Skeleton

After you have answered the last question, the generator will create the project's skeleton. If you have the `tree` command on your system, then you can visualize the directory structure:

    my-dizmo $ tree
    .
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── assets
    │   ├── Icon-dark.svg
    │   ├── Icon.svg
    │   └── Preview.png
    ├── gulp
    │   ├── package.js
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── *
    ├── gulpfile.js
    ├── help
    │   └── en
    │       ├── help.md
    │       └── placeholder-400x275.png
    ├── package.json
    └── src
        ├── index.html
        ├── index.js
        ├── lib
        │   └── lodash-*.min.js
        └── style
            └── style.css

Let's have a look at each ot the top level files and directories:

* `LICENCE`: By default an [ISC](http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) (Internet Software Consortium) license is generated, which is functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT licenses, but with a simpler language. Leave or change this according to your needs.

* `README.md`: A simple shortened version of this README.md; it is meant to provide a quick overview, and can then be replaced with a project specific content.

* `assets`: A folder containing asset files like images, which can be accessed from within the dizmo using a relative path like `assets/Preview.png`. Put any such files (or media) which are not directly related to styling into this folder. You can also create sub-folders or any nested directory structure according to your needs.

* `gulp`: A folder containing a build system based on [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). If you are familiar with `gulp`, then you can change the build mechanism according to your needs; otherwise, just use it as it is.

* `gulpfile.js`: The main script driving the `gulp` build system; usually you can leave this file as it is.

* `help`: Once you've developed your dizmo, you might want to provide a user documentation, which can be placed in this folder.

* `package.json`: This is an important file! It is consumed by the [npm] package manager, provides run scripts for the build system (like `lint`, `clean`, `make`, `install` etc.), and allows to change the dizmo settings. Have a look at the corresponding section for further information.

* `src`: A folder containing your own scripts for your dizmo, like `index.html` and `index.js` plus style sheets under `style/`. Further, in the `src/lib/` folder you can put third party libraries, which you can then reference via a `<script>` tag in the `index.html` markup.

## Package manager: package.json

Dizmos use [npm] as a package manager; to thoroughly understand its functionality, please consult [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) and work through the 15 small video based tutorials in the *Getting Started* section.

### Dizmo section

In addition to the default entries of [npm] the `package.json` file contains a `dizmo` section:

    "dizmo": {
        "install-to": "",
        "settings": {
            "bundle-identifier": "com.example.my_project",
            "height": 240,
            "width": 480
        }
    }

Lets have a look at each entry:

* `install-to`: Your dizmoViewer caches locally installed dizmos in a location that looks on Unix likes system similar like this:
```
/home/user/.local/share/dizmo/dizmo/user/InstalledDizmos/
```

where `user` would e.g. be your login. If you set `install-to` to this path, then you will be able to directly build and install a dizmo to the given path.

* `settings`: Any entry provided here will be translated to an entry in `build/Info.plist`, which is the main control file defining the properties of a dizmo. Each entry key is converted to camel-case, before being translated.

#### Defaults

The `dizmo` section in `package.json` can be extended with default values, which have to reside in `.generator-dizmo/config.json` (in *any* of the parent directories). For example, to set the credentials and the upload URL for dizmoStore, use the following content:

    {
        "dizmo": {
            "credentials": {
                "password": "my-password",
                "username": "my-username"
            },
            "urls": {
                "upload": "http://store-api.dizmo.com"
            }
        }
    }

The configuration is hierarchical and recursive, i.e. that a `.generator-dizmo/config.json` file can be saved in any parent directory of the current project's path, all of which are then merged during the build dynamically into `package.json`, where configuration files in the lower levels have precedence.

#### `npm install` vs `npm run-script install`

Please note that `npm install` and `npm run-script install` are *two* different actions! While the former installs all dependencies provided in `package.json` *and* runs the latter, the latter simply builds the dizmo and copies the `*.dzm` file to the `install-to` destination.

This means that if you are sure that all your dependencies have been installed and are met, then you can quickly invoke `npm run install` (which is much faster thant `npm install` due to the lack of dependency checks).

## NPM scripts

Please read first [npm#scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts); in each `package.json` the following scripts should be available:

* `clean`: removes the `./build` sub-directory completely.
```
npm run clean
```

* `install`: builds and installs the dizmo to a installation path given by the `install-to` configuration.
```
npm run install
```

* `install`: or if the `DIZMO_INSTALL_TO` environment variable has been provided then the dizmo is copied to the corresponding location.
```
DIZMO_INSTALL_TO=$DIZMO_INSTALL_TO npm run install
```

* `lint`: applies linting to your source code, but it in not available in the basic generator.
```
npm run lint
```

* `make`: builds the dizmo (including the `*.dzm` archive) from scratch and puts it into the `./build` sub-directory.
```
npm run make
```

* `test`: ensures to run tests; by default no tests nor a test framework are pre-defined (therefore a simple `exit 0` script has been provided). It's up to the dizmo developer to decide how tests shall be implemented. The only condition is, that the main test script should provide an exit value of `0` in case of success.
```
npm run test
```

* `watch`: watches your source code, and incrementally rebuilds the dizmo on any change.
```
npm run watch
```

* `watch`: further, it copies the build to the installation path if either the `install-to` configuration has been set in `package.json` or `DIZMO_INSTALL_TO` environment variable has been given.
```
DIZMO_INSTALL_TO=$DIZMO_INSTALL_TO npm run watch
```

## Build

Once your dizmo is build, a `build/` folder with the following structure will be available:

    my-dizmo $ tree build/
    build/
    ├── MyDizmo
    │   ├── Icon-dark.svg
    │   ├── Icon.svg
    │   ├── Info.plist
    │   ├── Preview.png
    │   ├── assets
    │   │   ├── Icon-dark.svg
    │   │   ├── Icon.svg
    │   │   └── Preview.png
    │   ├── help.zip
    │   ├── index.html
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── lib
    │   │   └── lodash-*.min.js
    │   └── style
    │       └── style.css
    └── MyDizmo-0.0.0.dzm

* `MyDizmo-0.0.0.dzm`: A ZIP archive of the `MyDizmo` folder with a version suffix, which has been defined in `package.json`. Please see [semantic versioning and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) for further information. You can drag and drop this file onto dizmoViewer to instantiate a dizmo.

  In dizmoViewer only the dizmo bundle with the highest version number is cached! Therefore, it is important to increase the version, when releasing a dizmo to your audience. However, simply changing the version suffix in the `*.dzm` file name will *not* work: the version is required to be set in `MyDizmo/build/Info.plist` (which happens automatically based on the version information in `package.json`).

* `MyDizmo/Info.plist`: a list of properties (in XML notation) defining a dizmo; this file is derived from the original `.info.plist` template file, which has been enriched with information from `package.json`.

* `MyDizmo/assets`: a copy of the original `assets` folder;
* `MyDizmo/help.zip`: a ZIP archive of the original `help` folder;
* `MyDizmo/index.html`: the main HTML script;
* `MyDizmo/index.js`: the main JavaScript;
* `MyDizmo/lib/lodash-*.min.js`: a sample third party library;
* `MyDizmo/style/style.css`: CSS style sheets.

## Advanced sub-generators

Once you have accommodated yourself with the basics of dizmo development, you can go further and try out the advanced `dizmo:ext`, `dizmo:ext-coffee-script`, and `dizmo:ext-type-script` sub-generators.

It's in theory possible to run the advanced sub-generators even after having edited the basic skeleton, but only as long as the original directory structure has been left in place. Using this feature you can later-on convert your basic dizmo projects to more advanced ones.

### dizmo:ext &ndash; extended skeleton

Invoke the `dizmo:ext` sub-generator with:

    yo dizmo my-dizmo --ext

This will run the basic generator and then apply on top of it the extended sub-generator, which will create or modify the project's standard structure:

    my-dizmo $ tree
    .
    ├── .eslintrc.json
    ├── gulp
    │   ├── package.js
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── *
    ├── package.json
    └── src
        └── style
            └── style.scss

The extended features are:

* **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` to start linting. But since now, `npm run make` and `npm run install` are dependent on it, there is no need to manually start it. The `.eslintrc.json` file can be used to configure the linting process for JavaScript files.

* **SASS:** Instead of `style.css` you can now work with `style.scss` [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) style sheets.

* **Minification:** All JavaScript, HTML and CSS files will be minified (with `htmlmin` and `uglify`).

### dizmo:ext-coffee-script &ndash; CoffeeScript integration

Invoke the `dizmo:ext-coffee-script` sub-generator with:

    yo dizmo my-dizmo --ext-coffee-script

This will run the basic generator and then apply on top of it the extended CoffeeScript sub-generator, which will create or modify the project's standard structure:

    my-dizmo $ tree
    .
    ├── coffeelint.json
    ├── gulp
    │   ├── package.js
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── *
    ├── package.json
    └── src
        ├── index.coffee
        └── style
            └── style.scss

The extended features are:

* **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` to start linting. But since now, `npm run make` and `npm run install` are dependent on it, there is no need to manually start it. The `coffeelint.json` file can be used to configure the linting process for CoffeeScript files.

* **SASS:** Instead of `style.css` you can now work with `style.scss` [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) style sheets.

* **Minification:** All JavaScript, HTML and CSS files will be minified (with `htmlmin` and `uglify`).

* **CoffeeScript:** Using the `index.coffee` file you can start developing your application in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

### dizmo:ext-type-script &ndash; TypeScript integration

Invoke the `dizmo:ext-type-script` sub-generator with:

    yo dizmo my-dizmo --ext-type-script

This will run the basic generator and then apply on top of it the extended [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) sub-generator, which will create or modify the project's standard structure:

    my-dizmo $ tree
    .
    ├── .eslint.json
    ├── .tslint.json
    ├── gulp
    │   ├── package.js
    │   └── tasks
    │       └── *
    ├── package.json
    ├── src
    │   ├── app
    │   │   ├── app.ts
    │   │   ├── dizmo.ts
    │   │   ├── window.ts
    │   └── style
    │       └── style.scss
    └── tsconfig.json

The extended features are:

* **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` to start linting. But since now, `npm run make` and `npm run install` are dependent on it, there is no need to manually start it. For JavaScript files the `.eslint.json` and for TypeScript files the `.tslint.json` configuration can be used to control the linting process.

* **SASS:** Instead of `style.css` you can now work with `style.scss` [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) style sheets.

* **Minification:** All resulting JavaScript, HTML and CSS files will be minified (with `htmlmin` and `uglify`).

* **TypeScript:** Using the `index.ts` file you can start developing your application in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Miscellanea

### GIT initialization

Invoke a generator (or a sub-generator) combined with the `--git` option:

    yo dizmo my-dizmo --git

The created project folder will now be named `my-dizmo.git`, and it will be initialized as a GIT repository; no commits will be performed though. Further, this only will work, when the `git` command is accessible.

### Dependency management

All (sub-)generators support dependency management using [Node modules][node-module]: You can structure your dizmo code using `require`, `exports` and `module.exports` objects. Further, you can install external third party libraries and reference them directly with `require`. For example to use `jQuery` run:
```
npm install --save jquery
```
Then in your code you can get a reference with:
```
var jQuery = require('jquery');
```
If you want to remove an installed library just run:
```
npm remove --save jquery
```

This approach works well, as long as the external libraries are not too large, since otherwise the build process can take longer. In such cases you should use the incremental builder using the watcher:
```
npm run watch
```
Or you can simply drop a library into the `src/lib/` sub-directory and reference it accordingly via a corresponding `<script>` tag in the `index.html` markup.
